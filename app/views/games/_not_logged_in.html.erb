    <p class="mb-4">Welcome to our Reversi Board Game project, where you can play against an AI or another player. The goal of the game is to have the most pieces of your color on the board at the end of the game.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Rules:</p>
    <ul class="mb-4">
      <li>Players take turns placing pieces on the board</li>
      <li>A piece can only be placed on a square that is empty and adjacent to a square that contains an opponent's piece</li>
      <li>All opponent's pieces between the newly placed piece and any of the player's pieces are flipped to the player's color</li>
      <li>The game ends when neither player can make a valid move or the board is full</li>
      <li>The player with the most pieces of their color on the board at the end of the game wins</li>
    </ul>
